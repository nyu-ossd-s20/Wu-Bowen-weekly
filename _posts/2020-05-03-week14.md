## Monday Presentation

On Monday, we discussed how our small issue became something much larger than we expected. I mentioned the back and forth last blog, but this week we finally were able to get in touch with some of the contributers to disucss a possible pair programming session on the issue. This would definitely help us with their large code base which their explanation has been causing us some confusion. 

The pair programming session will occur on Thursday of the upcoming week, so in my next blog I'll discuss exactly what happened and send a link to the video where our pair programming session occurs.

## Next Issue

Because of the delayed responses, we've also decided to take a on another issue seen [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21565). Briefly this issue is an error with the website page where "Certain pages of dot-org are missing id="reach-skip-nav" in the <main> element meaning that our skip-nav doesn't work". This seems like an issue that is a lot more straight forward, as we're able to test this a lot more easily.

This issue will be a nice change in pace because this is a switch to their front end, something we can directly see the change of. We hope to finish this issue a lot quicker while our Page-content warning issue is in the background.
